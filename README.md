# Etch-a-sketch project

This repository is the third project of the Foundations path of the Odin Project self-taught project (https://www.theodinproject.com/). The Odin Project is focused on building knowledge by doing.

The main goal of the "REtch-a-sketch" project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) is to practice skills of updating the DOM: listening and handling user generated events, creating some difficult layouts, etc.

This project supports some extra features: 
1. You can change the field size by dragging the slider and then pressing the Refresh button. 
2. You can choose a color to draw or use a random color in each cell. 
3. You can use different methods of drawing: by sliding your mouse over cells or by clicking on cells. You are able to combine both methods if you wish.
